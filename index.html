                <p>Hello! I recently graduated from the <a href="http://http://www.usc.edu/" target="blank">University of Southern California (USC)</a> with my Masters in Computer Science. During my time at USC, I worked as a graduate research assistent in the <a href="http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/" target="blank">Interaction Lab</a> under the advisement of <a href="http://www-robotics.usc.edu/~maja/" target="blank">Maja Mataric</a>. As a part of the lab I researched in the field of Human-Robot Interaction by developing computational (algorithmic) models for robot behavior.
